						<h3>Myself and interests</h3>
						<p>Growing up in an athletic family helped develop many positive habits for myself. I was lucky to have a family that pushed towards a healthy and sport filled upbringing. Tennis rose to the top of that list at an early age, and I was able to compete in provincial and national events growing up. </p>
						<p>In highschool my interest in finance and technologyu started to growReading many books gave me a deeper interest and passion for learning about my own personal investment choices and the larger future possible. This was where I had started tinkering with Python and my first taste of the coding world began. The interest in coding from this beginning is something that kept me coming back into the field and only further growing my interest.  </p>
